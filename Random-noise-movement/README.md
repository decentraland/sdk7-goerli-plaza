This scene shows you how to use the random noise library to simulate an organic-looking series of random values.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

1. Download this full repository from [sdk7-goerli-plaza](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-goerli-plaza/tree/main), including this and several other example scenes on SDK7.

2. Install the [Decentraland Editor](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/editor/)

3. Open a Visual Studio Code window on this scene's root folder. Not on the root folder of the whole repo, but instead on this sub-folder that belongs to the scene.

4. Open the Decentraland Editor tab, and press **Run Scene**

Alternatively, you can use the command line. Inside this scene root directory run:

```
npm run start
```

**Scene Usage**

Notice how the grass moves following a pattern that randomizes movement smoothly, never repeating itself but maintaining coherence.
