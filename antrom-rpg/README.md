## Instructions
> IMPORTANT: In this version with SDK7 the game is not working yet. First we are working on migrating the different UI's and then we will work on the game code itself. 

## Try it out

**Previewing the scene**

1. Download this repository.

2. Install the [Decentraland Editor](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/editor/)

3. Open a Visual Studio Code window on this scene's root folder. Not on the root folder of the whole repo, but instead on this sub-folder that belongs to the scene.

4. Open the Decentraland Editor tab, and press **Run Scene**

Alternatively, you can use the command line. Inside this scene root directory run:

```
npm run start
```

To test each migrated UI you must set up the chosen component by importing it in `index.ts` from the `migrated-ui/` location and its corresponding file.
