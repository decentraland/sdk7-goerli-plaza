![preview](https://github.com/TheCryptoTrader69/SDK7-Shooting-Range-Advanced/blob/main/images/preview.gif)

## Description
Gun game mechanic along with bullet marks that appear at whatever angle the bullet strikes the target.

## Instructions
Make sure you stand inside the shooting area marked in red before firing at the targets. Use your mouse to look around and <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> keys on your keyboard to move forward, left, backward and right respectively. Press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to jump and the <kbd>Left Mouse Button</kbd> to shoot.

## Issues
If the targets is set to spin too quickly then the bullet marks might appear hidden beneath the target's geometry as the bullet mark isn't generated fast enough.
