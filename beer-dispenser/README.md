## Description

A beer dispenser that uses P2P messaging so that you can pour beer for yourself and friends.

> IMPORTANT: In this version with SDK7 the P2P is not working yet, and

## Instructions

Pick up and put down the beer glass using the <kbd>E</kbd> key - you will only be able to place the beer glass on a flat surface that's pointing upwards. To fill a glass, place it at one of the bases on the dispenser and then press on the corresponding tap using the the <kbd>E</kbd> key again; to drink the beer just press the <kbd>F</kbd> key. Use your mouse to look around and <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> keys on your keyboard to move forward, left, backward and right respectively. Finally, pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key will make your avatar jump.

If you launch a scene preview and open it in two (or more) browser windows, each window will be interpreted as a separate player and a mock communications server will keep these players in sync.

_Note: If you open separate tabs in the same window, the interaction wonâ€™t work properly, as only one tab will be treated as active by the browser at a time._
