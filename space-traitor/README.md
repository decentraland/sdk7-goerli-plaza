## Brief

This is a multiplayer game about deceiving and guessing other player's identities. It takes plenty of inspiration from Among Us, but brings similar mechanics into a 3d medium.

At least 3 (or better 4) players must ring the bell of the space station, then the game starts.

A traitor is picked randomly, that player will secretly play against the others.

This scene is built using Colyseus as an authoritative server, syncing all changes to players via Websockets.

### Game mechanics

Once at least 3 players have accepted the game, a countdown will start. During this countdown, other players can join, otherwise the game begins.

Once the game begins, one of the players is selected at random to be the traitor, this player is given instructions to act secretively.

A 5 minute countdown starts, non-traitor players hav to fix 8 machines before this countdown ends, otherwise the traitor wins. The machines are fixed by playing a randomly selected UI mini-game. Some equipment might randomly break over time too.

The traitor can also sabotage fuse boxes by cutting cables. By cutting all cables in a fusebox, the time for solving the game gets reduced significantly, favoring the traitor.

At any moment during the game, anyone can hit the vote button on the main hall and start a voting round. All players left alive must vote for someone to be kicked out. If the traitor is kicked out, other players win.

That's why the traitor must act discretely, as cutting wires out in the open will alert them of who he is and vote him out. The game is designed to make everyone doubt each other and suspicions to fly all over the place.
